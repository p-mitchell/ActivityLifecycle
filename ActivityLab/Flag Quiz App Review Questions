FlagQuiz App Review:

1. The Settings Menu:
The menu is only visible in Portrait View - how is this controlled?
		
		this is set by setting the orientation to 'ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT'

Where is the menu icon stored in Resources?
		
		the cog image is stored in the drawable folder in the 'res' section

How do you display the Settings Menu either (i) on the App bar or (ii) within the options Menu?

		on the app bar by touching the cog image

How do you show only text for the menu?

		change the item element to showAsAction




2. Flag Shake Animation:
There are 3 animations in one set.
What is the difference between an android:toXDelta attribute value of "-5%p" and "-5%" ?
What would the animation's behaviour be if the android:startOffset attribute was not set?
		
		the addition of the 'p' in moves the images by 5% of the parents width, where without the 'p' the image would move a 5% of the views width 

		the start offset for each animation is needed because each animation of the flag takes 100 ms.
		without the delayed start, each animation would cancel each other out and the flag would not move.


View the Ryanair App. It has an animation that comes in from the bottom.
What type of tweened animation is it and what attributes does it use?

		fromYdelta




3. Different Layouts - Portrait and Tablet Landscape:
Phone: Portrait Orientation only - how is this set?
		
		this can be set in the android manifest
		as screenOrientation="portrait"  andsetting it to always visable

Tablet: Portrait and Landscape Orientations exhibit different behaviours.
With reference to both using qualified names and the layout files explain both behaviours.

		in portrait layout there is a button on the top to open the setings and start a new quiz, 
		where in landscape view there is are two fragments, one for the main view of the flag quiz and one for the settings
